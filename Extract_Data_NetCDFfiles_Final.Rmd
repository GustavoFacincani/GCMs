He we are going to create function to extract all data of interest from a basin's shapefile.
In this case, I'll use "Mer.shp", "Tuo.shp", "Stn.shp", "USJ.shp", which are files that contain multiple polygons (subbasins), for the watersheds: Merced, Tuolumne, Stanislaus and Upper San Joaquin. I used the file "allbasin_subwatersheds" we have on box (the 4 basins are together, but I split the shapefile into 4 using QGIS).

```{r}
#If you want just one GCM, one RCP scenario or one variable, you can just "mute" (#) the undesired ones in the first lines of this function, before the loop for the years

NetCDF_Extract <- function(shapefile, basin) { #basin = name of folder in which you'll save the data
  
#Set directory where files are going to be saved
wd <- setwd("C:/Users/gusta/Desktop/PhD/CERCWET/GCMs/")

#Path to shapefiles that are used
shp_path <- "C:/Users/gusta/Desktop/PhD/CERCWET/GCMs/Shapefiles/"

#Path to save the csv files

finalpath <- paste( "C:/Users/gusta/Desktop/PhD/CERCWET/GCMs/",basin,"/",GCM,"/",rcp,"/",sep="" )
		#if the directory doesn't exist, make it!
		if (!dir.exists(finalpath)){
			dir.create(file.path(finalpath), recursive = TRUE)
		}


#Let's define what we want to read
rcps <- c("rcp45", "rcp85") #both emission scenarios
variables <- c("ET", "Tair", "baseflow", "precip", "rainfall", "SWE", "runoff", "snow_melt", "snowfall", "tot_runoff")
GCMs <- c("CanESM2", "CNRM-CM5", "HadGEM2-ES","MIROC5",  #these we already have
              "ACCESS1‐0","CCSM4", "CESM1-BGC","CMCC-CMS","GFDL-CM3","HadGEM2-CC")#all 10 GCMs

  
#Let's loop through 2006-2100

#set final path 
for (GCM in GCMs){
  for(rcp in rcps) {
    for(variable in variables) {
      for(year in 2006:2100){

Shp_file$SUBWAT <- gsub("^.{0,4}", "sb", Shp_file$SUBWAT) #switch names in the attribute table of the shp file
#these shapefiles have basin names as MER_01, MER_02, etc. So, here I'm selecting the first 4 digits, and switching them for "sb", so that I can use this attributes later to split the .csv file directly by subbasin, already with the same labels we currently have on Box
Shp <-Shp_file["SUBWAT"]
