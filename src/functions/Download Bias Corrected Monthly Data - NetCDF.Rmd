The ones we need:
UF 16, "Stanislaus R at N Melones Rsv" == VIC's "N_MEL"
UF 18, "Tuolumne R at Don Pedro Rsv" == VIC's "DPR_I"
UF 19, "Merced R at Exchequer Rsv" == VIC's "LK_MCC"
UF 22, "San Joaquin R at Millerton Rsv" == VIC's "MILLE"

Others:
UF  6, "Sac R near Red Bluff" == VIC's "SAC_B"
UF  8, "Feather R near Oroville" == VIC's "OROVI"
UF  9, "Yuba R at Smartville" == VIC's "SMART"
UF 10, "Bear R near Wheatland" == VIC's "BEARC"
UF 11, "American R at Fair Oakes" == VIC's "FOL_I"
UF 14, "Mokelumne R at Pardee Rsv" == VIC's "PRD-C"
UF 15, "Calaveras at Jenny Lind" == VIC's "N_HOG"
