In this script, daily data is extracted from NetCDF files (raw data from http://albers.cnr.berkeley.edu/data/scripps/loca_vic-output/) using shapefiles 
of basins with multiple polygons (subbasins). First, I tried doing it for one file, using one shapefile. Then, as it worked fine, in the second section, I create a function to do it automatically to multiple files.

```{r}
#load packages that are going to/can be used
library(dplyr)
library(raster)
library(ncdf4)
library(maptools)
library(foreign)
library(RNetCDF)
library(rgdal)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#TEST section

#Set directory where files are going to be saved
wd <- setwd("C:/Users/gusta/Desktop/PhD/CERCWET/GCMs/")

#Path to shapefiles that are used
shp_path <- "C:/Users/gusta/Desktop/PhD/CERCWET/GCMs/Shapefiles/"


#Let's define what we want to read
rcp <- "rcp45" #emission scenario
variable <- "tot_runoff" #it will be in mm/day
GCM <- "CanESM2"  #GCM
basin <- "Merced"
shapefile <- "Mer.shp"

#Let's loop through 2006-2007 only

#set final path 

      for(year in 2006:2007){
  #read in the netCDF data 
  dpath <- paste0(wd,"/",GCM, "/",rcp,"/",variable,".",
                  as.character(year),".v0.CA_NV.nc", sep="")
 
  file <- brick(dpath)
  nl<-nlayers(file) #give me the number of layers in the netCDF file 

  finalpath <- paste(wd,"/",basin,"/",GCM,"/",rcp,"/",sep="") #save result here
		#if the directory doesn't exist, make it!
		if (!dir.exists(finalpath)){
			dir.create(file.path(finalpath), recursive = TRUE)
		}

df = list() #set the dataframe we want, to be a list, in order to store all results of the loops
subbasin = list() #set the dataframe we want, to be a list, in order to store all results of the loops

# begin of loop
for (i in 1:nl){ #using number of layers

# Extract the raster file of layers
r <- raster(file, layer = i)

# Extract relevant information from shapefile
Shp_file <- shapefile(paste0(shp_path,shapefile, sep = ""))
Shp_file$SUBWAT <- gsub("^.{0,4}", "sb", Shp_file$SUBWAT) #switch names in the attribute table of the shp file
Shp_file$AREA <- area(Shp_file)

#these shapefiles have subbasin names (attributes) as MER_01, MER_02, etc. So, here I'm selecting the first 4 digits, and switching them for "sb", so that I can use this attributes later to split the .csv file directly by subbasin, already with the same labels we currently have on Box
Shp <-Shp_file["SUBWAT"] #where we have names of the basins

# Ensure command extract is from raster package
extract <- raster::extract
# Extract the mean value of cells within AMC polygon
# Alternative: look to "mask" function ?mask
masked_file<-extract(r, 
                    Shp, #shapefile
                    fun = mean, #this gives the mean observed values in the region, if fun = NULL, we will have values for each point, with the respective weight for each point
                    na.rm=TRUE,

Now that I know it is working (although it takes a VERY LONG time! (over 7h to extract total runoff data for Merced)), I'll create a function based on the code above.

```{r}
#REAL

#Create function to extract all data from a basin
#The function's input are the name of the shape file of the basin I'm using and the basin name (to create a folder in my computer named after it)
#Shapefiles for which I'll use this function are: "Mer.shp", "Tuo.shp", "Stn.shp", "USJ.shp", which are files that contain multiple polygons (subbasins)
#If you want just one GCM, one RCP scenario or one variable, you can just "mute" (#) the undesired ones in the first lines of this function, before the loop for the years
