This command donwloads NetCDF downscaled (LOCA) data from here: http://albers.cnr.berkeley.edu/data/scripps/loca_vic-output/

The 10 GCMs that are relevant to California's situation to be used for 4th California Climate Assessment

The data of each model is saved in a folder with its name in the directory, with subfolders for each the RCP scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 in this case), containing the variables of interest
